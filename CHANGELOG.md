## [2.5.1](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.5.1) - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- ``potctl release sync`` / ``assert`` include ``pyproject.toml`` so the PyPI package version stays lockstep with meson/CMake/cargo/pixi (missed for 2.5.0, which left pip at 2.4.2).

### Miscellaneous

- PyPI ``rgpot`` 2.5.1 manylinux wheel and sdist ship the 2.5.0 Metatomic multi-ABI / SoftGil / pkg-config surfaces (2.5.0 tag published crates.io + GitHub only).


## [2.5.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.5.0) - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Multi-language Codecov coverage (Rust, C++, Python, Fortran) with OIDC uploads. ([#47](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/47))
- Install headers and ``rgpot.pc`` (``nwchempot`` / ``cpmdpot`` / ``ptlrpc``; no
  torch or xTB at link time) so eOn and other hosts can prefer
  ``dependency('rgpot')`` over the Meson subproject wrap. Engines stay runtime
  dlopen. See ``docs/eon_pkgconfig.md``.
- Keep Metatomic **dlopen** product on pip: portable `libmetatomic_engine.so` plugin (no eonclib) + `evaluate_metatomic` frontend (not LJ-only wheels).
- Metatomic dual path: linked ``MetatomicPot`` (fast) and ``MetatomicDlopen``
  frontend plus optional ``libmetatomic_engine.so`` C ABI (slow/plugin path).
- Metatomic engines are built for each supported torch major
  (``rgpot/lib/torch-X.Y/libmetatomic_engine.so``) and selected at runtime from
  the installed torch version — same multi-ABI model as metatomic-torch itself.
  The pip product covers **torch 2.7 and newer**; earlier majors are out of scope.
- MetatomicConfig gains an explicit ``torch_determinism`` policy
  (``TorchDeterminismPolicy::Fast`` default, ``Strict`` opt-in). Strict mode
  enables deterministic LibTorch algorithms, math-only scaled-dot-product
  attention (flash / memory-efficient / cuDNN SDP disabled), deterministic
  cuDNN with benchmarking off, deterministic fill of uninitialized memory, and
  disables TF32 for cuBLAS and cuDNN. These flags are process-global via
  ``at::globalContext()``; Fast never mutates them. CUDA hosts still need
  ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8`` (or ``:16:8``) before the first cuBLAS
  call for bit-stable matmuls.
- Portable Metatomic engine wheels: `$ORIGIN` RUNPATH to site-packages torch/metatomic
  (single build-time torch major; multi-ABI package dirs cannot be listed oldest-first).
  `scripts/rgpot_build_wheel.sh` always runs RPATH repair after `python -m build`.
- Python bindings use **nanobind** with **stable ABI** (abi3 / Py_LIMITED_API 3.12)
  when built on Python >= 3.12 (same policy as pyeonclient). Metatomic engines are
  packed multi-ABI under ``rgpot/lib/torch-X.Y/`` and selected from the installed
  torch major at runtime. Supported libtorch majors start at **2.7** (engines for
  2.7–2.13 ship in the manylinux wheel); torch 2.6 and older are not bundled.
- Python package `rgpot` is pip-installable: core Lennard-Jones bindings via
  meson-python wheels (`import rgpot; rgpot.evaluate_lj(...)`), plus optional
  Metatomic multi-ABI engines for **torch 2.7+**.
- xTB dual backends: keep linked ``XTBPot`` and add ``XTBDlopen`` +
  ``libxtb_engine.so`` C ABI plugin (same pattern as metatomic engine).

### Fixed

- Metatomic C ABI engines soft-release the GIL so pyeonclient Job.run can evaluate forces under torch autograd without a fat metatomic link.
- SoftGilRelease in the metatomic C ABI only calls PyEval_SaveThread when PyGILState_Check is true, so nested GIL release from pyeonclient Job.run is safe.


## [2.2.1](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.2.1) - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Windows/MSVC builds no longer fail on unused ``cxxabi.h`` includes or nested
  ``std::array`` box flattening in ``Potential`` (``C1083`` / ``C2676``).


## [2.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.2.0) - 2026-07-05

### Added

- A profile-driven ABI loader (`rgpot::abi::ProfileLoader`) resolves the minimum
  potential ABI available from a single install prefix.

### Changed

- The canonical potentials-schema contract is pinned at v1.13.0, adding the
  Capabilities discovery surface; the in-tree `Potentials.capnp` copies track it
  byte-for-byte.

### Fixed

- `rgpot-core` publishes to crates.io again: `dlpk` (0.1.5) and `eindir-core`
  (0.5.0, `capi`) now resolve from the registry instead of git pins, and the
  `publish = false` guard is gone.


## [2.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.1.0) - 2026-07-03

### Added

- eOn integration: eOn ships an in-process `RgpotPot` potential (`-Dwith_rgpot=true`) that consumes rgpot's `NWChemPot` / `CPMDPot` frontends as a Meson subproject and `dlopen`s `libnwchemc` / `libcpmdc` directly, with `potserv` remaining available for out-of-process RPC. See `docs/orgmode/howto/eon-rgpot.org`.

### Changed

- The Cap'n Proto schema is pinned to canonical [potentials-schema](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/potentials-schema) v1.12.0: `MetatomicParams` arm (union ordinal 4) with the upstream requested-outputs surface, typed NWChem and CPMD parity batches (dplot/esp, prop/linres/pimd/path/tddft), `CommonMethodSpec` overlay, and a schema-sync CI gate that fails when the vendored copies diverge from the pinned release.

### Fixed

- Release-prepare CI no longer runs `cargo publish --dry-run` for `rgpot-core` while it depends on git-only `dlpk` / `eindir-core` (not on crates.io). The job uses `cargo check -p rgpot-core --locked`, and `package.publish` is `false` until registry deps exist. ([#42](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/42))


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.0.0) - 2026-06-26

> Channel note: `v2.0.0` was prepared on `main` but never tagged or published;
> the content below first ships in `v2.1.0`.

### Added

- NWChemPot backend: stable message-based C ABI (`nwchem_c_abi.h`), always-built frontend with `dlopen` of optional `libnwchemc`, stub ABI for CI without NWChem, Cap'n Proto `NWChemParams`/`configure @1`, and `potserv ... NWChem`.
- CPMDPot backend: always-built frontend with `dlopen` of optional `libcpmdc` (split [`cpmdc`](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/cpmdc) engine), Cap'n Proto `CPMDParams` / `PotentialConfig.cpmd` / `configure`, structured `CPMDInputSection` arms, in-tree `cpmdc_fake_engine` for CI without CPMD, and `potserv ... CPMD`. Engine lookup: `CPMDC_LIBRARY`, `RGPOT_CPMDC_ENGINE`, `RGPOT_CPMD_ENGINE`, then `enginePath` on params.
- rgpot potentials are now eindir objectives: `rgpot_potential_t` embeds eindir's `eindir_objective_t` as its first member (zero-cost IS-A), with the embedded eval/grad callbacks routed through the rgpot force callback (gradient = -force). rgpot-core consumes `eindir-core` as a shared Cargo crate rather than a prebuilt static lib, so downstream Rust consumers (e.g. `anneal-core`) can minimize an rgpot potential through `eindir_core::Objective<f64>` without a two-Rust-runtime conflict. See `docs/orgmode/howto/eindir-anneal.org`.

### Developer

- CI authoring uses a Nickel `ci/gha/` library with a single hand-maintained
  `ci-orchestrator.yml` for PR/main jobs (prepare/plan, hygiene, build/rust/bridge,
  potentials, CI gate), and nickel-exported workflows only for release, docs,
  cosmo potctl, and doc-commenter. Removed redundant `build`/`prek`/`potentials`/
  `docs_quality`/`towncrier`/`cosmo-potctl-spike` committed workflows in favor of
  the orchestrator plus `gen-gha`/`gha-drift` for the remaining exports. ([#40](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/40))

### Changed

- NWChemPot is now a pure consumer of the split [`nwchemc`](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/nwchemc) engine: the in-tree NWChem embed (`nwchem_c_abi.c`, `nwchem_embed_c_api.f90`, `nwchem_embed_legacy.F`) and the `-Dwith_nwchem`/`-Dnwchem_root`/`-Dnwchem_target` build options are removed. The frontend always builds and `dlopen`s `libnwchemc.so`; the capnp schema is synced byte-for-byte to nwchemc's canonical superset so a flat `NWChemParams` round-trips with no field loss.


## [1.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.2.0) - 2026-06-24

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding via the xtb C API (GFNFF, GFN0/1/2-xTB). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. RPC names ``XTB``, ``GFNFF``, ``GFN0xTB``, ``GFN1xTB``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding via the tblite C API (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: load metatomic TorchScript models directly in C++ (vesin neighbor lists, autograd forces). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. Requires vesin 0.5+ (``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``). ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Units module (``rgpot/units.hpp``): CODATA 2018 constants plus a runtime unit expression parser, with Cap'n Proto ``lengthUnit``/``energyUnit`` negotiation on the RPC boundary. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))

### Developer

- Lockstep monorepo release via cocogitto 7 + towncrier + ``potctl`` (``potctl/``,
  not published): ``cog bump`` runs ``potctl release sync`` then towncrier then
  ``potctl release assert --require-changelog``; ``release.yml`` publishes
  ``rgpot-core`` on stable ``v*`` tags. CI ``potentials.yml`` builds xtb/tblite and
  metatomic/vesin backends.
- Release tooling in ``potctl`` (Rust workspace crate): lockstep assert
  (meson/CMake/cargo/towncrier/pixi), fail-fast CHANGELOG gate, ``release sync``
  writes all surfaces, cargo publish --locked only, RC tags skip crates.io,
  release-prepare cargo dry-run, SECURITY.md and CODEOWNERS for release surfaces.

### Fixed

- MetatomicPot: target vesin 0.5+ ``VesinDevice`` struct (``{VesinDeviceKind, device_id}``, pass ``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``) and zero-initialized ``VesinOptions`` (``sorted`` / ``algorithm``).


## [1.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.1.0) - 2026-03-29

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding potential via xtb (GFNFF, GFN0, GFN1, GFN2). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding potential via tblite (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: ML atomistic models via metatomic/PyTorch with autograd forces and vesin neighbor lists. Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Shared unit conversion header (``rgpot/units.hpp``) with CODATA 2018 physical constants for Angstrom/Bohr, Hartree/eV, and Boltzmann conversions. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))


## [1.0.3](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.3) - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- MSVC/clang-cl compatibility: use ``/W3`` instead of GCC/Clang warning flags and skip ``-lstdc++`` link arg on Windows ([#31](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/31))


## [1.0.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.2) - 2026-03-01

### Added

- External integration guide covering namespace collision mitigation when embedding rgpot as a subproject ([#30](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/30))

### Changed

- CI dependency bumps and cleanup to prevent trailing whitespace in generated headers ([#29](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/29))


## [1.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.0) - 2026-02-15

### Added

- feat(build): add release CI workflow, meson subproject install guards, CMake FetchContent readiness, and package version config
- feat(cache): add a RocksDB integration
- feat(ci): add `rust_tests` job using cargo-nextest on Ubuntu and macOS with default and `--all-features` configurations

- feat(rust): integrate DLPack tensor exchange protocol via `dlpk` crate — core types now use `DLManagedTensorVersioned*` for device-agnostic data exchange, with borrowed (non-owning) and owned tensor helpers in new `tensor` module
- test(rust): add 39 unit tests covering types, status codes, potential lifecycle, C API, null-pointer handling, error propagation, and `free_fn` invocation

### Changed

- chore(build): add Meson `with_rust_core` option, `rust-test` / `rust-test-all` pixi tasks, and `cargo-nextest` dependency

### Fixed

- fix(cpp): remove incorrect `extern "C"` trampolines from `LJPot.hpp` and `CuH2Pot.hpp` that used raw `int` returns and `void*` params; use typed `PotentialHandle::from_impl<>()` template instead
