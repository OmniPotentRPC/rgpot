 *
 * C ABI of the neighbour query. Call rgpot_nlist_request_init before
 * setting cutoff. The first field of every caller-allocated struct is
 * bytes, the size the caller compiled. A later version may append
 * fields. It does not reorder the fields below and it does not change
 * the meaning of a value. A break of that rule bumps RGPOT_NLIST_ABI.
 *
 * Positions and cutoff are one length unit. The library does not
 * convert. box9 is nine doubles, lattice vectors as rows, the ASE cell
 * in row-major order: ax ay az bx by bz cx cy cz. The pair vector is
 * r_j - r_i + S H, with S the integer shift. A pair of an atom with
 * itself at shift zero is never returned.
 *
 * rgpot_nlist_build and rgpot_nlist_walk_pull may be called on different
 * objects at the same time. One walk, and the buffers of one build, are
 * used by one thread. build may start an OpenMP team when OMP_NUM_THREADS
 * is set and the system has at least 8192 atoms. A smaller system stays
 * on the calling thread. Do not call build from inside an OpenMP region.
 * There is no mutable global. rgpot_nlist_strerror returns a literal.
 *
 * The walk borrows positions and box9 until rgpot_nlist_walk_close.
 * The caller keeps those arrays alive and does not write them from
 * another thread during a pull.
