// Public neighbour query. Potentials and this query share updateCells and
// visitDirected. Neighbours is the cell list those calls walk. The stable
// list is a structure of arrays: a pair shell or a cluster of four,
// triclinic and partial periodic boundaries, a skin rebuild, and a chunked
// walk that does not store the pairs.
//
// Distinct Table, Builder and Walk objects may be used from different
// threads. One object is not shared. build() may start an OpenMP team
// when OMP_NUM_THREADS is set, so do not call it from inside an OpenMP
// region. There is no mutable global. A Walk borrows positions and the
// box until it is destroyed. A View is invalidated by the next update
// of the table that owns it.
