/* MIT License
 * Copyright 2023--present rgpot developers
 *
 * C ABI between librgpot and librgpot_mpi, the separately built library that
 * carries every MPI call of the calculator groups.
 *
 * librgpot never links MPI. The calculator-group entry points in
 * CalculatorGroup.hpp that need MPI (bindCalculators, calculatorsUseMpi)
 * load librgpot_mpi on first use with dlopen and resolve one symbol,
 * RGPOT_MPI_API_SYMBOL, which returns the table below. A process that never
 * asks for calculator groups therefore never maps libmpi or its transport
 * layers (UCX installs memory hooks at load time).
 *
 * Search order of the loader (rgpot::loadCalculatorMpi):
 *   1. an explicit path passed to loadCalculatorMpi;
 *   2. the RGPOT_MPI_LIBRARY environment variable;
 *   3. RGPOT_MPI_LIBRARY_NAME in the directory holding librgpot itself;
 *   4. RGPOT_MPI_LIBRARY_NAME through the dynamic linker's search path.
 *
 * Versioning: abi_version changes when a member changes meaning;
 * struct_size grows when members are appended. A loader accepts a table
 * whose abi_version equals RGPOT_MPI_ABI_VERSION and whose struct_size is
 * at least the size it was compiled against.
