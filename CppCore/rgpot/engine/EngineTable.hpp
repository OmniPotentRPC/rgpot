/**
 * @file EngineTable.hpp
 * @brief One implementation of the generic engine C ABI over any
 * @c PotentialBase.
 *
 * `EngineTable.cc` exports every `rgpot_engine_*` symbol of
 * `engine_c_abi.h` for an engine library. The library supplies what only the
 * backend knows by defining `rgpot::engine::create` and
 * `rgpot::engine::backend_name`; the adapter does argument validation, the
 * coordinate transform, batching, the error text, the thread-safety policy,
 * the identity queries and the Python GIL release.
 *
 * Thread safety of a handle follows the backend's @c PotCaps::reentrancy:
 * - @c SharedInstance: any number of threads may call force and force_batch on
 *   one handle at once.
 * - @c PerInstance: the adapter admits one call at a time per handle, so a
 *   handle is safe from any thread and calls on it are serialized.
 * - @c ProcessSerial: the adapter admits one call at a time in the process
 *   across all handles of the library.
 * Setting calls (threads, charge and spin) and destroy must not run
 * concurrently with a call on the same handle.
