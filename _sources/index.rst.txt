Overview
--------

``rgpot`` provides a unified schema for interfacing potential servers across
languages using runtime interoperability. It combines a Rust core with C++
potentials exposed through a Cap'n Proto RPC layer, enabling language-agnostic
access to potential energy surface calculations.

.. code:: bash

    cd rgpot && pixi shell
    meson setup bbdir -Dwith_tests=True --buildtype=debug
    meson compile -C bbdir && meson test -C bbdir
