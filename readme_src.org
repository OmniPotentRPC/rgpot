* RPC Generalized Potential Library

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/refs/heads/main/branding/logo/rgpot_logo.webp]]

Originally designed for interfacing easily to potentials implemented [[http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/eon/][in
eOn]], but has grown to be more flexible.
** Usage
Setting up and running tests:
#+begin_src bash
pixi shell
meson setup bbdir -Dwith_tests=True --buildtype="debug"
meson test -C bbdir
#+end_src

~cmake~ works as well.
#+begin_src bash
cmake -B build -DRGPOT_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DRGPOT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
#+end_src

For building only the client, with CXX17 and CapnProto only:
#+begin_src bash
cmake -B build_client\
    -DRGPOT_RPC_CLIENT_ONLY=ON\
    -DRGPOT_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build_client
# needs a server instance, so in another terminal
# say from the meson.build
./bbdir/CppCore/rgpot/rpc/potserv 12345 LJ
# now test
ctest --test-dir build_client/ --output-on-failure
#+end_src

*** Developing locally
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
#+end_src
*** Handling actions
To keep the build matrix setup manageable, we use Nickel.
#+begin_src bash
pixi r gen-gha
#+end_src
