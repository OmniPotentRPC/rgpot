* Embedding as a Subproject

This page covers how to embed rgpot into another C/C++ project using meson
or cmake as a subproject dependency.

** Meson

Add a =subprojects/rgpot.wrap= file or vendor the source directly into
=subprojects/rgpot/=.

*** Full library build (server + potentials)

Use this when your project hosts an RPC server with rgpot's built-in
potentials:

#+begin_src meson
rgpot_proj = subproject('rgpot',
    default_options: ['with_rpc=true', 'with_tests=false'])
rgpot_dep = rgpot_proj.get_variable('rgpot_dep')
#+end_src

*** RPC schema only (client mode)

Use this when your project only needs to /call/ a remote potential server,
or when you want to avoid namespace collisions with your own types (see
[[file:integration.org][integration guide]]):

#+begin_src meson
rgpot_proj = subproject('rgpot',
    default_options: ['with_rpc_client_only=true', 'pure_lib=true'])
ptlrpc_dep = rgpot_proj.get_variable('ptlrpc_dep')
#+end_src

The =ptlrpc_dep= provides only the Cap'n Proto schema and generated code,
without pulling in =Potential.hpp= or the existing C++ potentials.

** CMake

rgpot also provides a CMake build. To use it as a subdirectory:

#+begin_src cmake
add_subdirectory(external/rgpot)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE rgpot::rgpot)
#+end_src

*** Build options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------+---------+-------------|
| =RGPOT_BUILD_TESTS= | =OFF= | Build the test suite |
| =RGPOT_BUILD_EXAMPLES= | =OFF= | Build example programs |
| =RGPOT_RPC_CLIENT_ONLY= | =OFF= | Build only the RPC client (schema library) |

#+begin_src bash
cmake -B build -DRGPOT_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DRGPOT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
#+end_src

** Windows (MSVC)

rgpot builds on Windows with MSVC 2022. Install Cap'n Proto via
conda-forge or vcpkg, then use the standard meson or cmake workflow. No
special flags are required since v1.0.3.

For conda-forge builds, the following are handled automatically by the
build system:

- =capnp compile= is used instead of =capnpc= (the Windows =capnpc.EXE=
  does not support the =-o= flag)
- Generated =.c++= files are renamed to =.cpp= (MSVC does not recognize
  the =.c++= extension)
- =ws2_32= is linked for Cap'n Proto's async networking layer
